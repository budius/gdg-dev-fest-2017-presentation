# Unpacking the Power of LiveData

This repo is just a few code snippets used for the presentation "Unpacking the Power of LiveData" for the 2017 GDG DevFest Berlin.

The code possibly compiles, but won't do anything.
Most of it was used just to have a pretty code format to copy+paste into the slides.
